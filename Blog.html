					<h3>IRIS Internship Week 1</h3>
					<p class="researchpar">
<b>My first week!</b><br>
This week I started my internship in Dr. Peng's computational geophysics lab at Georgia Tech. On Sunday I made the 9-hour drive from STL to ATL, and moved into the apartment above the garage of my dad's house. I was a little nervous about this living arrangement at first, but it's actually been very nice. I am able to operate on my own schedule, but can still see my little brother and my dogs when I need to destress. The only thing I've had trouble with so far is waking up in the morning, but that's nothing new! Overall, the transition to Atlanta and working life has been easier than I thought it would be, if not perfect.

<br><br>
Due to covid, the entire lab seems to be in a state of transition. Most members are still remote, which has been a blessing and a curse for me. On one hand, it has given me lots of time to work with Dr. Peng one-on-one, and I have not been overwhelmed with new names and faces. On the other hand, however, I have not yet met any of the other lab members I will be working with. Also, the FIRE ALARM went off on my very first day!! As we walked out, Dr. Peng shared an anecdote with me about a previous fire alarm, when some professors got caught hiding behind their desks trying to continue getting work done, and every time I picture this I laugh. For my work in the lab, Dr. Peng introduced me to something he calls "Earthquake Music" which is basically a way of depicting the acoustic measurements his lab is recording. I find this so fascinating, since it's such an extreme break from the typical squiggly line graphs you see from seismometers, and it really emphasizes the power behind 'quakes! So far, I've been able to take some example Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) and transform it into readable .wav files. The first time I played the file on my computer, it was extremely quiet so I turned my volume all the way up and leaned in. All of a sudden, BANG!!!! the AE signal blared through my speakers. That's a mistake you definitely only make once. Other than that, this week has been about getting logged into the various servers, getting access to the building, and other administrative stuff. It's definitely been a slow start, especially as far as learning new concepts goes. However, that's largely because Dr. Peng is saving most of the project introductions for when the other IRIS intern, Mandy, gets here next week. I'm very glad I ended up in one of the sites with two interns, if only so it won't just be me learning everything for the first time around a group of seasoned seismologists. (Also I want someone to explore Atlanta with, so hurry up Mandy!!)

<br><br>
<b>Goals for the first third of the internship:</b><br>
This is my first internship, so I want to use this chance to adapt to life outside of school. I am looking forward to better understanding what a job in this lab looks like, as well as just getting used to pulling a regular 9-5, packing my lunches, etc.

<br><br>
<b>Goals for the second third of the internship:</b><br>
After I've had some time to adjust to the lab setting, I want to drastically improve my coding. To be completely honest, when Dr. Peng was getting me set up with remote access to the servers using ssh, I had to look up how to open terminal on my mac....... The only real coding experience I have is with MATLAB, and even then it's more that I have memorized and can regurgitate simple commands. I want to understand why I do certain things, plus really know what they are doing.

<br><br>
<b>Goals for the final third of the internship:</b><br>
Finally, after having almost two months to get comfortable in the lab environment and with coding, I want to take on a bigger role in my project. By this point, I will be thinking about my AGU presentation, and this is something I want to be proud to present as my own. It's not enough to be given some instructions that I blindly follow; I want to own my research that I present. Therefore, for the final third I really want to be in control of where my project is going, and decide how to interpret and present my findings. 

<br><br>
<b>Some final, random goals:</b><br>
Throughout the summer, I also want to talk to the grad students in the lab about their grad school experience. I want to make connections in this field and at Tech, and I want to understand how people decided their careers. I also want to become better at regulating my schedule, so that I get a healthy amount of sleep, eat at normal meal times, and have time for exercise.
