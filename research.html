<b>My Thoughts</b><br>
Quals. Comps. Prelims. No matter what you call them, the name alone is enough to strike fear into the hearts of would-be PhDs everywhere. But what really is the qualifying exam? This depends heavily on your program, but it can vary from an actual eight-hour written test to a presentation and oral examination. In our department, it consists of a 15-page report and a subsequent oral exam that lasts around two hours. Quals are scary, but they're also extremely exciting. As I have quickly learned in grad school, the odds of getting the concurrent undivided attention of three or more faculty members without a department-backed reason are basically zero. In this way, quals are a unique chance to get feedback on your research from experts in your field. Don't get me wrong, I spent plenty of time stressing before mineâ€”I don't think I'll ever forget the feeling of working into the early hours of the morning the last few nights leading up to the exam. However, by the time the actual presentation started, I was more excited than anything else. With all this in mind, my biggest piece of advice for preparing for quals is to love and believe in your research. :) And don't panic!
<br><br>
                        
Just as the exam can take many different forms, so too can your research preparedness at the time of quals. In my experience, there are three main groups. One group is made up of students who have already completed one or two smaller first-year projects and are now outlining their primary thesis work. The second group of students came into grad school with a specific project in mind and have already made considerable progress on their main work. The third group, on the other hand, spent their first two years in the planning stage and have barely even begun any "actual" research. This group can feel especially scary because a big part of quals is demonstrating your competency to complete the rest of your PhD research, and you may feel like you don't have anything to back up your proposed work. (I of course, was a member of this third group.)

<b>My Proposal</b><br>
With all this in mind, I chose to make my quals report more similar to a funding proposal than a research article, emphasizing the work to come and why I think it's both important and doable. Halfway through writing, I found out my FINESST application had been accepted; this was a huge boost since my quals report was basically a more detailed version of the FINESST proposal. In order to still emphasize my research preparedness within the structure of the proposal, I packaged the work I'd already accomplished as a proof of concept experiment. For a short summary, you can see the <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=1029971/solicitationId=%7B2CA37D02-F6A7-9746-68C1-8B681D7532EA%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/FINESST-23%20Planetary%20Science%20Division%20Selections%20October%2024%202024.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">accepted FINESST proposal abstract here</a>.
