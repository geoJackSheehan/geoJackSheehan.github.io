<b>What I Do</b><br>
Quals. Comps. Prelims. No matter what you call them, the name alone is enough to strike fear into the hearts of would-be PhDs everywhere. But what really is the qualifying exam? This depends heavily on your program, but it can vary from an actual eight-hour written test to a presentation and oral examination. In our department, it consists of a 15-page report and a subsequent oral exam that lasts around two hours. Quals are scary, but they're also extremely exciting. As I have quickly learned in grad school, the odds of getting the concurrent undivided attention of three or more faculty members without a department-backed reason are basically zero. In this way, quals are a unique chance to get feedback on your research from experts in your field. Don't get me wrong, I spent plenty of time stressing before mine—I don't think I'll ever forget the feeling of working into the early hours of the morning the last few nights leading up to the exam. However, by the time the actual presentation started, I was more excited than anything else. With all this in mind, my biggest piece of advice for preparing for quals is to love and believe in your research. :)
<br><br>
<b>How I Do It</b><br>
Just as the exam can take many different forms, so too can your research preparedness at the time of quals. Some sudents have already completed one or two smaller first-year projects, while others came into grad school with a specific project and have already made considerable progress on it. Still others yet are in the planning stage, and have barely even begun the "actual" research behind their project. This last one can feel really scary because a big part of quals is demonstrating your competency to complete the rest of your PhD research, and you may feel like you don't have anything to back up your proposed work. As you may be able to tell, I was a member of this third group!

Some sudents have already completed one or two smaller first-year projects, while others came into grad school with a specific project and have already made considerable progress on it. Still others yet are in the planning stage, and have barely even begun the "actual" research behind their project.

<br><br>
With this in mind, I chose to make my quals report more similar to a funding proposal than a research article, emphasizing the work to come and why I think it's both important and doable. Halfway through writing, I found out my FINESST application had been accepted; this was a huge boost since my quals report was basically a more detailed version of the FINESST proposal. In order to still emphasize my research preparedness within the structure of the proposal, I packaged the work I'd already accomplished as a proof of concept experiment. You can read my full proposal <a href="qualsproposal.html">here</a>, but below is my one-page summary. (See the <a href="#research1">current research box</a> for a much briefer plain-language summary.)
                        
<br><br>
<b>Did Earth Have a Late Veneer? Determining the Behaviors of Highly Siderophile Elements During Core Formation</b><br>
Late accretion, or the addition of material following planetary core segregation, plays a crucial role in producing a habitable planet. The late veneer refers to a hypothesis of late accretion that suggests ~0.7% of Earth's mass was accreted in the form of chondritic meteorites following the last giant impact and the cessation of core formation. This hypothesis is invoked to explain the dichotomy between the relatively high observed abundances of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), and the lower abundances predicted by core formation models and metal--silicate partitioning experiments (Walker, 2009; Brennan and McDonough, 2009). Understanding the final stages of planetary accretion is important to evaluate primitive core and mantle compositions, which will help us better constrain early planetary habitability. 

<br><br>
Previous attempts to quantify the delivery of material in a late veneer based on HSE partitioning behavior assumed the BSE HSE abundances were too high to be explained by core formation alone, necessitating HSE delivery after core differentiation via a late veneer (Brennan and McDonough, 2009). However, these arguments were based on extrapolated partition coefficients from multi-anvil cell experiments at much lower pressures and temperatures (Righter et al., 2008; Mann et al., 2012). 

<br><br>
Taking advantage of recent technological advancements in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell apparatus and recent work combining N-body simulation outputs with core formation modeling, this proposal aims to reevaluate the necessity of a late veneer in Earth's history by studying the partitioning behaviors of HSEs directly at core forming conditions. By basing our calculations on novel experimental results at higher pressure--temperature conditions than previously investigated, we will be able to determine the HSE signature left by core formation more accurately than in previous work. At the time of writing, only one element (Pt) has been analyzed this way (Suer et al., 2021). We propose to analyze four additional elements, Au, Ru, Rh, and Re, to better constrain the abundances of HSEs in the mantle following core formation. This in turn will constrain the amount of chondritic material needed in a late veneer to reach the bulk silicate Earth HSE abundances we see today. 

<br><br>
There are three potential outcomes of this proposal: <br>
1. Core formation alone can explain the BSE HSE abundances due to decreasing siderophility at higher P--T conditions, and we will find no evidence requiring a late veneer. <br>
2. HSE siderophility does not change enough with changing P--T to completely explain BSE abundance, so the addition of chondritic material in the late veneer is necessary. <br>
3. Core formation produces HSE abundances higher than the BSE, so an additional process is required like the late veneer suggests; however, it is required to remove mantle HSEs, not add them. 

<br><br>
These scenarios have all been suggested previously (Righter et al., 2008; Bennett et al., 2014, Armstrong et al., 2019), but this proposed work will allow us to distinguish between them with a much higher degree of certainty than any prior study. We will accomplish this by combining experiments on the partitioning of multiple HSEs at the actual conditions of Earth's core formation with a sophisticated model of these processes for the first time. While our proposed results focus on Earth's late accretion, the implications for the late veneer hypothesis will apply to terrestrial planet accretion throughout the Solar System and other stellar systems. Due to its role in determining Earth’s chemical composition and characterizing the dynamic processes of solar system evolution, obtaining a refined understanding of late accretion is vital to understand why our planet is habitable.
